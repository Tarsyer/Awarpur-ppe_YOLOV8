This Project has task to detect:
* hard_helmet
* jacket
* hand_without_gloves
* gloves
* suit
* suit_helmet
* head

We have used YoloV8M model to detect these multi classes
As MobileNetV3 does not work on multi class

I have not added model files here, as filesize was much.
You can download those models from

```https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-kgI8dqu0r9DG46OcdlSNcXvHbIGEDad?usp=sharing```

There are 3 different models for 3 different areas.
name of model file is likewise.
